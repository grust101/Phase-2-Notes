User Authentication Breakout 

Sessions: Why?
- we want to persist state accross mulitple pages
- we want log in info to be persistant accross pages so they don't have to keep logging in

Other ways to persist state (other than sessions)
- redirect using a query string ex : /welcome/?id=#{@id}
- store id as an instance variable
SECURITY ISSUE: id is exposed in URL

 Cookies can be changed on the client and servers
 
BCrypt
- you cannot store plain text passwords into a database - need to encrypt them  
-
Creating a new user
- User.create(username: Georgia, password: "123"
- when you create a user it breaks it down into step
  1. u = User.new()
  2. u.username = "Georgia"
  3. u.password = "123"
  4. u.save
-bcrypt accesses this process at step 3
  def password 
    1. encrypt
    2. sets password_hash field
    3. u.password_hash = encrypted version
    
- save password as anything other than :password in your table
- bcrypt will take your password and encrypt it 


Memoization: ||= (lazy valuation)
if something already has a value other than nil, return the value. 
But is something is nil or has no value, reassign the value

Sessions:

- enable it in environment
- create sessions controller file
- simple route 
  get '/' do
  "hello"
  end
- make sure it's working
- change simple route
  get '/' do
  "hello"
  end
- create an index.erb file for sessions
- write log-in & register buttons on layout page so that it's an option on every page
- go back to sessions controller
-write get methods for log-in and register
get '/register' do 
  erb :'user/new'
end
