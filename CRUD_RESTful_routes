Writing Put & Delete in Sinatra
***write these methods as post methods using the name _method & the value "put" OR "delete"
PUT 
<form method= "post" action="dogs/<%= @dog.id %>">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put"
  ****continue form *****
  </form>

DELETE
<form method= "post" action="dogs/<%= @dog.id %>">
  <input type="hidden" name="_method" value="put"
  ****continue form *****
  </form>
